# Verify Migration Applied Successfully

## Method 1: Check in Supabase Dashboard (Easiest)

1. Go to your Supabase dashboard
2. Click on **Table Editor** in the left sidebar
3. Look for the `prompt_completions` table in the list
4. If you see it, the migration worked! âœ“

## Method 2: Check the Schema

1. In Supabase dashboard, go to **Table Editor**
2. Click on `prompt_completions` table
3. Verify it has these columns:
   - `id` (uuid)
   - `user_id` (uuid)
   - `prompt_id` (uuid)
   - `completed_at` (timestamp with time zone)
   - `notes` (text)
   - `created_at` (timestamp with time zone)

## Method 3: Check RLS Policies

1. In Supabase dashboard, go to **Authentication** â†’ **Policies**
2. Look for `prompt_completions` table
3. You should see 4 policies:
   - "Users can view own completions"
   - "Users can insert own completions"
   - "Users can update own completions"
   - "Users can delete own completions"

## Method 4: Test with SQL Query

1. In Supabase dashboard, go to **SQL Editor**
2. Run this query:
   ```sql
   SELECT table_name, column_name, data_type
   FROM information_schema.columns
   WHERE table_name = 'prompt_completions';
   ```
3. If it returns 6 rows (one for each column), it worked!

## Method 5: Test in the App (Best Test)

1. Make sure your dev server is running: `npm run dev`
2. Open http://localhost:3000/dashboard
3. You should see the "Mark as Complete" button
4. Click it - it should change to green "Completed!"
5. Refresh the page - the button should stay green
6. Click again to unmark - it should go back to blue

If all of the above work, your migration is successful! ðŸŽ‰
