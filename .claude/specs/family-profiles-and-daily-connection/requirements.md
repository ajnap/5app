# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature transforms the current single-user activity app into a comprehensive family connection platform. Parents will be able to create profiles for multiple children, receive personalized daily connection prompts, complete guided activities with reflections, and track meaningful engagement over time. The system builds on the existing prompt library and completion tracking while adding family-centered personalization and a gentle, faith-informed daily rhythm.

7. IF an activity is marked complete THEN the system SHALL display positive reinforcement messaging

### Requirement 5: Positive "Missed Day" Handling
**User Story:** As a parent, I want to feel supported rather than guilty when I miss a day so that I stay motivated to continue connecting.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN a new day begins and the previous day's activity is incomplete THEN the system SHALL mark it as missed without negative messaging
2. WHEN a parent opens the app after missing a day THEN the system SHALL display a gentle, reframing message like "That's okayâ€”tomorrow's another chance to connect"
3. WHEN viewing streak history THEN the system SHALL show missed days in a neutral visual style (not red/alarming)
4. IF a parent misses multiple consecutive days THEN the system SHALL offer a "fresh start" option to reset their streak without shame
5. WHEN a parent returns after missing days THEN the system SHALL welcome them back with encouragement

### Requirement 6: Memory Journal and Quick Reflections

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN a parent completes an activity THEN the system SHALL offer a quick reflection option with minimal friction
2. WHEN adding a reflection THEN the system SHALL support multiple input types: text (up to 500 characters), voice note (up to 2 minutes), or photo upload

4. WHEN a photo is uploaded THEN the system SHALL compress and store it securely with the journal entry
5. WHEN viewing a child's profile THEN the system SHALL display a chronological memory journal feed
6. WHEN a journal entry is created THEN the system SHALL include metadata: date, associated activity, child name, and entry type

2. WHEN viewing the dashboard THEN the system SHALL show each child's current streak, last activity completed, and upcoming prompt
3. WHEN a parent selects a child THEN the system SHALL navigate to that child's detailed view with personalized content
4. WHEN viewing a child's page THEN the system SHALL display: today's prompt, recent completions, current streak, and memory journal preview
5. IF no children are added THEN the system SHALL display onboarding guidance to add the first child

### Requirement 8: Growth Tracking Foundation

2. WHEN viewing a child's profile THEN the system SHALL display a visual breakdown of activity distribution across dimensions
3. WHEN a week or month completes THEN the system SHALL calculate summary statistics for each dimension
4. IF activity distribution is heavily weighted toward one dimension THEN the system SHALL gently suggest exploring other areas

6. IF a streak is broken THEN the system SHALL emphasize total activities completed rather than dwelling on the break

### Requirement 10: Faith-Based Optional Integration
**User Story:** As a parent with faith values, I want optional spiritual reflection prompts so that I can deepen the meaning of our connection activities.

5. IF a parent prefers secular content THEN the system SHALL function fully without any faith-based elements
6. WHEN faith preferences are set THEN the system SHALL allow parents to change this setting at any time

## Edge Cases and Constraints

### Edge Cases
1. **Multiple children with same activity on same day**: System should track completions separately per child
2. **Timezone changes during travel**: System should respect user's current timezone for "new day" calculations
3. **Child ages out of current content**: System should gracefully suggest expanding content library or aging up prompts
4. **Voice note storage limits**: System should compress audio and enforce 2-minute limit per recording
5. **Offline activity completion**: System should queue completions and sync when connection restored
6. **Account deletion**: System should provide data export option before permanent deletion

### Constraints
1. **Data Privacy**: All child data must be encrypted at rest and in transit
2. **Performance**: Daily prompt generation must complete within 2 seconds
3. **Storage**: Photo uploads limited to 10MB per image, auto-compressed to 2MB
4. **Accessibility**: All UI elements must meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards
5. **Mobile-first**: Design must prioritize mobile experience while supporting web access
6. **Existing Integration**: Must preserve and build upon existing prompt library (78 activities) and completion tracking system
