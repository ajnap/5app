# Requirements Document: UX Enhancement Features

## Introduction
This feature set enhances the user experience with empty states, completion celebrations, and activity time tracking. These improvements address first-time user guidance, emotional engagement, and practical time management needs for busy parents.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Empty State Components
**User Story:** As a new user, I want clear guidance when I have no data, so that I understand what to do next and feel welcomed rather than confused.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN user has zero children THEN system SHALL display welcoming empty state with "Add Your First Child" CTA
2. WHEN user views favorites page with no favorites THEN system SHALL display encouraging message with "Browse Prompts" CTA
3. WHEN user has zero streak THEN system SHALL display motivational "Start Your Journey" message instead of "0 days"
4. WHEN user views prompt library with filters yielding no results THEN system SHALL display "No prompts match your filters" with reset option

### Requirement 2: Completion Celebration Animations
**User Story:** As a parent completing activities, I want delightful celebrations, so that I feel motivated and rewarded for investing time in my child.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN user completes an activity THEN system SHALL trigger confetti animation for 2-3 seconds
2. WHEN user reaches streak milestones (7, 14, 30, 60, 90 days) THEN system SHALL display special milestone celebration modal
3. WHEN user completes activity THEN system SHALL animate streak counter increment with smooth transition
4. WHEN milestone reached THEN system SHALL play celebratory animation BEFORE showing reflection modal
5. IF user completes first activity ever THEN system SHALL display "First Connection!" special message

### Requirement 3: Activity Timer and Duration Tracking
**User Story:** As a busy parent, I want to know how long activities will take and track my actual time spent, so that I can plan my day and see my investment in connection.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN prompt displayed THEN system SHALL show estimated duration badge (5, 10, 15 minutes)
2. WHEN user clicks "Start Activity" THEN system SHALL begin tracking elapsed time
3. WHEN user completes activity THEN system SHALL record actual duration in database
4. WHEN user completes activity THEN system SHALL display "You spent X minutes connecting today!" message
5. WHEN user views dashboard THEN system SHALL show total minutes spent this week/month
6. IF user takes longer than estimated THEN system SHALL show encouraging "Taking your time is great!" message

### Requirement 4: Loading States and Skeleton Screens
**User Story:** As a user waiting for content to load, I want smooth loading indicators, so that the app feels fast and responsive rather than broken.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN dashboard loads THEN system SHALL display skeleton screens for prompt cards
2. WHEN child profile loads THEN system SHALL display skeleton for stats and memories
3. WHEN prompt completions load THEN system SHALL show loading animation on calendar
4. WHEN data finishes loading THEN system SHALL fade in real content smoothly
5. IF data fails to load THEN system SHALL display error state with retry option

## Edge Cases and Constraints

### Edge Cases
- User refreshes page mid-activity (should preserve timer state)
- User completes activity offline (should sync when back online)
- Multiple milestone achievements in one completion (show highest milestone)
- Extremely long activity duration (>1 hour - ask if timer should have paused)

### Constraints
- Confetti animation must not block UI interaction
- Timer must not drain battery (update every 10 seconds, not every second)
- Skeleton screens must match actual component dimensions
- All animations must respect `prefers-reduced-motion` accessibility setting
- Empty states must maintain brand voice (warm, encouraging, faith-compatible)

## Success Metrics
- Time to first activity completion for new users
- Activity completion rate increase
- User return rate (daily active users)
- Average session duration
- Positive feedback on celebrations in user testing
