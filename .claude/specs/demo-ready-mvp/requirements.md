# Demo-Ready MVP Requirements

## Introduction

This spec focuses on polishing the existing application to deliver a world-class demo in 3 days. The app already has authentication, Stripe integration, child profiles, and a prompt library. We need to refine the daily connection experience, ensure deployment is solid, and add the critical features that demonstrate the unique value proposition: intentional, faith-informed family connection.

## Demo Success Criteria
- One or more working features that deliver on customer value proposition
- Functional back-end with Supabase, user authentication, and Stripe payments integrated ‚úÖ
- Application deployed to Vercel
- Free tier/trial signup functional ‚úÖ
- AI generated code review in .md file

## Edge Cases and Constraints

### Edge Cases
1. **User completes multiple activities in one day**: System should allow and count each separately
2. **Timezone handling**: Use user's local timezone for "new day" calculations
3. **No age-appropriate prompts available**: Gracefully suggest expanding age range or show closest match
4. **Onboarding interrupted**: Save partial progress and resume where they left off
5. **Deleted child with existing data**: Archive data, don't delete, allow restoration within 30 days

### Constraints
1. **Timeline**: Must be demo-ready in 3 days (by October 24, 2025)
2. **Performance**: All pages must load within 2 seconds on production
3. **Mobile-first**: Must work perfectly on iPhone and Android
4. **Data Privacy**: COPPA compliant (no personal data for children under 13 without parental consent)
5. **Build Time**: Vercel builds must complete within 5 minutes
6. **Database**: Use existing Supabase schema, minimize new migrations
7. **TypeScript**: Zero TypeScript errors on build
8. **Accessibility**: Minimum WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for interactive elements
