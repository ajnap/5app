1. **Ship consistently**: Small improvements weekly
2. **Listen to users**: Let them guide the roadmap
3. **Measure everything**: Data-driven decisions
4. **Stay focused**: Don't build everything at once
5. **Maintain quality**: Better to do less, really well

**The world needs this.** Parents are overwhelmed, kids crave connection, and you're building the solution. Keep going! 🚀
